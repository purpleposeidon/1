l1-wrapping a tty just isn't going to work
  - someone might write stuff from outside
  - if we don't wrap stderr, stuff might leak from there
  - echoing characters back; lots of stuff in the kernel; everything seems complicated

So we'll do the budding strategy?
... Mmm.

Okay, let's do this...

stdio goes to the tty
environment variable specifies a pipe for ttyatrio

So if it's a single program (like ssh), that program's gonna get two values from the variable.
    L1_TTYATRIO=4,5
And the front end of the pipe might get
    L1_TTYATRIO=4,-1

Let's actually call this a "frame". Programs no longer have to mingle their output, the shell can make it clean.

FIXME: ssh would like to ask for more frames

I think ultimately what we'd want is a way to go up to a tty FD and ask for a new frame fd to be created.
Also, wall(1) can use this.
