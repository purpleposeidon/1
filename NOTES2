Hey, let's annotate arguments while we're at it.
This can be suuuper simple, just an environment variable...
Wait no it can't. Well maybe it can. Uhm.

Environment variables get inherited.

# Anyways. What types of arguments are there?

/ Filepath
" String
- Switch
? Unknown
! command name [arg0; or something tab-completed from $PATH]

So this info could always be put into a variable. "ARGUMENT_TYPES", say.
But if a std program executes an atr program, that's trouble.

Our environment variable could have a "bash_pid->ls_pid" header; so you can say "yeah we've got annotations" if that info is correct.
... Furthermore, we could include the time? Enh. Enh. Mmm.
Does linux have anything more reliable than a process ID? Like a UUID?
Ah-ha! Here we go! We simply use a pipe! :D
    (With a NO_CLOEXEC flaggy thingie)


# End The Tyranny Of The vt100

This is an opportunity to make some improvements to emulators.

1. Escape codes are kind of shit. Just, like, the text of them. They could be rationalized, and they could also be made more human-readable in the style of HTML or bbcode.
    (Maybe not, like "red", but "fg=ff0000".)
2. We could expose more input events; so many as any GUI app might get.
3. It might be nice to have fonts that aren't monospace.
4. Possibly other features. "Make GUI Emacs redundant" might be a good goal.



# ...
Instead of -1 as a coreutils command switch, it could be --1. ls already has a -1 option... It would be annoying and stupid to have to know that different commands have different switches to enable lib1.
idea: set -1 makes it so that pipes crash if used in wrapped mode...? maybe could have a "i allow mixed modes" deal?


ATR_HIDDEN - like something that is stdvisible, but an atr terminal would not show...
