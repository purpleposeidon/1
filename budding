tty-stdin  |  ls -l  | grep root   | tty-stdout

ls
    stdin
    stdout
    atrout
    atrbud

grep
    stdin
    stdout
    atrin
    atrbud



So what grep must do is...
    open /dev/1
    pipe = mkfifo()
    bud = ioctl(/dev/1, L1_BUD)
    send_ancillary(bud, pipe.out)
    close /dev/1
    write everything to pipe.in

And what the terminal must do is...
    (and it has to be the terminal because the shell is busy)
    create a unix socket setup to receive ancillary files
    open /dev/1
    ioctl(/dev/1, L1_BUD_MOTHER, socket.right)
    spawn its process
    poll/read from:
        its pty end
        socket.left for ancillary files
        pipes received from the socket
